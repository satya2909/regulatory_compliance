INTRODUCTION\nBACKGROUND\n1.1. The applications of ionizing radiation bring many benefits to humankind,\nranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry and agriculture. One\nof the longest established industrial applications of radiation is the use of\nradiography for the non-destructive testing of items of equipment.

Industrial\nradiography provides a means of verifying the physical integrity of equipment\nand structures such as vessels, pipes, welded joints, castings and other devices.\nThe structural integrity of such equipment and structures affects not only the\nsafety and quality of the products but also the protection of workers, the public\nand the environment.\n1.2. Industrial radiography work poses a negligible risk if it is performed in a\nsafe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving industrial\nradiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing\nsevere health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death.\nMembers of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when\nradioactive sources used for industrial radiograph",

INTRODUCTION\nBACKGROUND\n1.1. The applications of ionizing radiation bring many benefits to humankind,\nranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry and agriculture. One\nof the longest established industrial applications of radiation is the use of\nradiography for the non-destructive testing of items of equipment.

Industrial\nradiography provides a means of verifying the physical integrity of equipment\nand structures such as vessels, pipes, welded joints, castings and other devices.\nThe structural integrity of such equipment and structures affects not only the\nsafety and quality of the products but also the protection of workers, the public\nand the environment.\n1.2. Industrial radiography work poses a negligible risk if it is performed in a\nsafe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving industrial\nradiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing\nsevere health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death.\nMembers of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when\nradioactive sources used for industrial radiograph",

Risk\ninformed decisions can be made in a graded approach to the regulatory control of\nradioactive sources for the purposes of safety and security.\nA.3. The categorization system is based on the concept of ‘dangerous sources’\n— which are quantified in terms of ‘D values’ [41]. The D value is the\nradionuclide specific activity of a source which, if not under control, could cause\nsevere deterministic effects for a range of scenarios that include both external\nexposure from an unshielded source and internal expo",

The operating organization carries out a safety assessment for any source of\nradiation under its control, to determine what steps are necessary to restrict the\nexposure of its employees. Both normal working conditions and the potential for\naccidents are considered in the safety assessment.\nI–2. The example safety assessment in the following covers the use of X rays\nand gamma rays in a purpose-built shielded enclosure for a hypothetical company\nperforming non-destructive testing. The following are considered in the\nassessment:\n(a) Normal operations for the purposes of radiography work within the\nenclosure;\n(b) Possible accident situations and steps to prevent accidents and to limit their\nconsequences;\n(c) Control measures to restrict exposures;\n(d)",

The IAEA safety\nstandards are also used by co-sponsoring organizations and by many\norganizations that design, construct and operate nuclear facilities, as well as\norganizations involved in the use of radiation and radioactive sources.\nThe IAEA safety standards are applicable, as relevant, throughout the\nentire lifetime of all facilities and activities — existing ",

INTRODUCTION\nBACKGROUND\n1.1. The applications of ionizing radiation bring many benefits to humankind,\nranging from power generation to uses in medicine, industry and agriculture. One\nof the longest established industrial applications of radiation is the use of\nradiography for the non-destructive testing of items of equipment.

Industrial\nradiography provides a means of verifying the physical integrity of equipment\nand structures such as vessels, pipes, welded joints, castings and other devices.\nThe structural integrity of such equipment and structures affects not only the\nsafety and quality of the products but also the protection of workers, the public\nand the environment.\n1.2. Industrial radiography work poses a negligible risk if it is performed in a\nsafe manner. However, experience shows that incidents involving industrial\nradiography sources have sometimes resulted in high doses to workers, causing\nsevere health consequences such as radiation burns and, in a few cases, death.\nMembers of the public have also suffered radiation overexposures when\nradioactive sources used for industrial radiograph",

Industrial radiography work by\nits nature is often carried out under difficult working conditions, such as in\nconfined spaces or extreme cold or heat. Working under such adverse conditions\nmight result in operational situations in which the principle of keeping doses as\nlow as reasonably achievable is challenged.

RADIOGRAPHY IN SHIELDED ENCLOSURES\nGENERAL\n10.1. A shielded enclosure is an enclosed space designed and engineered to\nprovide adequate shielding from ionizing radiation to persons in the vicinity.
